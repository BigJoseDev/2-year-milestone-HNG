      <h1>My Tech Goals (2-Years)</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
            July 2024 - September 2024:
            During this period, my primary objective is to excel in the HNG 11 internship program, striving to become one of the finalists. This entails rigorous dedication, continuous learning, and the application of best practices in frontend development. I will leverage this opportunity to network with industry professionals and acquire advanced technical skills.
        </li> <br>

        <li>
            October 2024 - January 2025:
            Post-HNG 11, my focus will shift towards securing an entry-level role as a frontend developer. I am committed to distinguishing myself through exceptional performance, diligence, and a proactive approach to learning. This phase will be crucial for gaining hands-on experience and refining my skills in real-world scenarios.
        </li> <br>

        <li>
            Mid-2025:
            By mid-2025, I aim to secure a position abroad as a junior frontend developer. This international exposure will not only enhance my professional portfolio but also provide me with diverse perspectives and innovative methodologies in the tech industry. I will be dedicated to adapting to new environments and contributing effectively to my team's success.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            2026:
            In 2026, my goal is to achieve mastery in my chosen niche within frontend development. This involves staying abreast of emerging technologies and continuously upgrading my skill set. I will invest time in specialized training, attending industry conferences, and participating in advanced projects to cement my expertise. Additionally, I will learn other technologies such as React Native and Node/Express.js to diversify my portfolio, enabling me to build a broader range of applications and solutions.
